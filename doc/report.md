I rarely used GitHub in the past as I never saw much use for it, but now that working with others and tracking development of projects is going to be a major part of my development process, I will certainly be using more often to get used to using it and familiarizing myself with all its features; public SSH key authentication in particular, which seems like an especially useful tool that will hopefully give me a deeper understanding of encryption in practice. I also intend to use GitHub as an easy access to useful functions that are currently stored on my machine. I was already familiar with modules in python and the naming conventions that help keep things tidy. Mark down files are new to me, though I have seen them in many other projects I never appreciated their use, I will be using them in future projects to keep good practice for anyone using my projects in the future. I have used pip and virtualenv in past python projects and am familiar with their features, as far as I can see venv is very similar to virtualenv and I will try using it in the future as it may be the default for my peers and using the same tools should help smooth out compatibility issues during development. Panda3D looks like a useful development tool for fun side projects but doesn't’ look like it could replace Unity as my go to rendering software. Command line controls are new to me and seem particularly useful. I will certainly be using them in future development to troubleshoot issues by leaving out different bits of code, and comparing different outputs by running different bits of code that do the same thing (a nice way to compare the speed of a given function when it’s running with the whole program instead of just by itself.).
